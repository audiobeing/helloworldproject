# variables and types
## objectives
- declare and assign values to variables
- get user input using prompt, and assign it to variables
- create comments in your JavaScript file
- list all the JavaScript data types
- distinguish between primitives and objects
## variables
A variable can be thought of as a container. Specifically, it is a container that holds the value of a data type. Without them we would be very limited with what we could do. 
```javascript
console.log("hello world"); 
```
The code above specifies writing "hello world" to the console in your browser.
